## About 💡

Rat God is an Open Source Discord bot that helps you in the game Escape From Tarkov, and is covered by the [Affero General Public License version 3](LICENSE)! The information is sourced from the game and the Official Wiki. It can be requested using [Discord's slash commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ). This bot benefits the user because it's a fast lookup for ammunition and maps details, presents unique data and is more than likely faster than looking it up on said Wiki!

This project is constantly being worked on and improved upon by a few people as a hobby. So please show your support in the [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/kg7VfRQ9Xw)!

This repository is for everything related to the website.

For bot description and features - see the [bot's repository](https://github.com/Froggi22/Rat-God).

### Data Collection 📊

This project does not collect nor store any data, thus not selling anything to 3rd parties - Because ignorance is bliss.

### Revenue 💰

The revenue this project generates is by generous donations on our [Patreon site](https://www.patreon.com/Froggi22) by kind souls like you!
